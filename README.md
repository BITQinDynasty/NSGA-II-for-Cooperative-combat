# NSGA-II for cooperative combat model of ground-based multi-platform
This is the priliminary work of my graduate project.
a bi-objective multi-stage sensor-weapon target assignment model under uncertainty is established
NSGA-II algorithm is used to solve this problem. this work is modified based on the work of Aravind Seshadri

////File name - Its function
NSGA2_on_DSWTA - main function
Generator - generate basic parametors of the model to verifying the proposed algorithm.
initialize_the_population - generate the initial population of NSGA-II
evaluate_objective - calculate the two objective value of the population
non_dominated_sorting - use the fast non-dominated sorting algorithm to sorting the population as well as calculating its crowded distance
tournament_selection - use the tournament selection mechanism to select a subset of population based on its rank untill fullfilling the pool
genetic_operator - use the designed crossover and mutation operator to generate new offspring.
repair_operator - repair the offspring generated by genetic_operator to make it feasible under constraint.
replace_chromosome - select individuals from hybrid population to the next generation
